What is this?  This is my digital garden, it's like a notebook but curated more like a garden is built.  Unlike the standard chronological order that is a blog norm, this is organized by complimentary objects.  Things are near each other that compliment each other.  Also, this shows my drafts that I'm currently working on.  By displaying the drafts, you can see the post as it grows.  Check out some of the top posts, or browse the various topics...Enjoy.
