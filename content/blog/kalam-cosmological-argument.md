I've been thinking heavily on the Kalām Cosmological Argument.  I'm finding it a fairly significant and well reasoned defense for the existence of God.  I understand that there are fundamental arguments against this, but from a simple reasoned defense, it is very compelling.  Most defenses against this argument for God tend to require a bit of mental gymnastics that go against Occam's Razor.

## The Argument

---Add the WLC Video---

First, let's define the argument.  The video above does a decent job of defining the argument and some of the rational behind them. Let's show the simplicity here:

1. Everything that begins to exist has a cause;
2. The universe began to exist;
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause.

### Proposistion 1: Everything that begins to exist has a cause

Without going into a deep analysis of this argument, we will use intuition to follow this proposition.  Looking at everything that is temporal, it has a cause.  A simple way of saying this is that a book was put together by the publisher/author/etc., water occurs by the arrangement of atoms in a particular way, or humans exist from star dust.  Everything that begins to exist, has a cause.

Kai Neilson, an atheist philosopher from the University of Calgary, puts it this way: "...suppose you hear a loud bang...and you ask me, 'What made that bang?' and I reply, 'Nothing, it just happened.' You would not accept that--in fact you would find my reply quite unintelligible."

Without diving into quantum physics, solipsism, and ontology arguments, the path to causality is easily warrented.

### Proposition 2: The universe began to exist

This argument takes two forms.  One, Big Bang Cosmology and two,
