By the very last few days of 2018, I was able to meet my reading challenge of 52 books for the year. That is crazy! I read more non-fiction this year than any other year, and I hope to read a more steady dose in the future. But it also meant that if it wasn't for my early lead I had at the beginning of the year, I probably wouldn't have made my goal. For 2019, I cut my goal in half because of this and things are still attainable. Per the usual, [Goodreads][] does a much better job presenting my reading for the year, so [check it out there][2018].

This was really hard to decide upon. I read so many really good books this past year that I didn't know if I could really choose.
