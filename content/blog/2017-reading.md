Wow!  Sixty (60) books!  2017 was another good year with regards to reading for me.  I was able to once again power through a ton a of books.  It was a year of series; only roughly 18 books out of the 60 were stand alone books.  Many of what I read were serial in nature and, towards the end of the year, I was beginning to get a little burned out on these stories.  Hopefully 2018 brings a refreshed view, or better feelings at least.  As always, [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) does a better job of presenting all the books, so [check it out there](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/1671848).

## Favorite Read

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dixwznarl/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:good,w_230/notebook/books/girl-with-all-the-gifts.jpg" class="align-left" title="Girl with All the Gifts" link="http://amzn.to/2CweoaJ" >}} [The Girl with All the Gifts](http://amzn.to/2CweoaJ) is an amazing read.  It's is at it's heart a zombie tale, but Carie was able to infuse it with so much heart that it feels different than anything else I've read from the genre.  Yes, there are mindless zombies, but The Girl is capable of generating empathy towards some of these that I have never experienced.  It was not just the specific characters I liked that I wrapped up in, but even with the characters I severely disliked, I was enthralled by their story and experience.  It was a book that Carey was able to pull me into and one that I could live through.  Great read.

## Favorite Series

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dixwznarl/image/upload/c_scale,h_350,q_auto:good/notebook/books/kingfountain-series.jpg" class="align-left" title="The Kingfountain Series" link="http://amzn.to/2EE6T7l" >}} [The Kingfountain Series](http://amzn.to/2EE6T7l) was one I picked up on a whim.  Looking for great fantasy that didn't include heavy violence or other gratuitous input...kind of an anti-Song of Ice and Fire read.  It is a story that follows a boy from childhood to adulthood, highlighting his ability to understand and work himself through bad situations.  Regardless of the age, it kept me interested and deeply hooked.  There are more books in this series now, and they should be queued up to read at some point in 2018.

## Favorite Non-Fiction

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dixwznarl/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:good,w_230/notebook/books/lost-world-of-genesis-one.jpg" class="align-left" title="Lost World of Gen. 1" link="http://amzn.to/2HwoBrk" >}} [The Lost World of Genesis One](http://amzn.to/2HwoBrk) was a fantastic read.  I have been exploring more into why science and scripture have this so-called friction with each other and Genesis 1 is the biggest sticking point.  I have constantly felt that in justifying certain passages of scripture, we always look at the context in which it was written.  But with Genesis, this strategy is often abandoned with expectations of literal interpretation.  This was a great read.

> "It seems to many that they have to make a choice: either believe the Bible and hold to a young earth, or abandon the Bible because of the persuasiveness of the case for an old earth. The good news is that we do not have to make such a choice. The Bible does not call for a young earth. Biblical faith need not be abandoned if one concludes from the scientific evidence that the earth is old."

## Biggest Surprise

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dixwznarl/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:good,w_230/notebook/books/the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time.jpg" class="align-left" title="The Curious Incident..." link="http://amzn.to/2C7F6dP" >}} [The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time](http://amzn.to/2C7F6dP) caught me by surprise.  I read it almost all in one sitting while driving through Connecticut and Vermont.  The main character has a social disorder that most people would stereotypically assign to autism.  So he has social issues but is very smart in math.  It has some fun things like Chapter numbers that are only Prime numbers, thoughts on the number of red cars on the road, and literal interpretations of anything that is said.  The story is--in essence--one of how Christopher reacts and grows in learning that the world is a much darker place than he's been lead to believe.

> "Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them."

## Bad Books

Nothing just jumped out at me as totally awful.  Most that I gave low scores to were mainly because one big thing threw off anything that was good about it.  Liu Cixin's [Death's End](http://amzn.to/2BFfXGb) was probably the worst read of the year.  It was full information and garbage that lead you nowhere and just ultimately fell flat.  [Lincoln in the Bardo](http://amzn.to/2HtdQGh) by George Saunders was filled with bad humor and plodding development.  [Not Alone](http://amzn.to/2EF4Z6v) by Craig A Falconer was an enormous read that was a really good story but, man, did it need massive editing...entire sections could have been removed and the length cut by a third and it would have been wonderful.
