For posterity sake, I figured I'd make the definitive list of the best sports teams ever.  The best sports teams in the mind of Trae.  If I did keep up with all these sports/leagues, then this would be the teams I'd follow.  Yes, that's right, I don't follow all these...but who cares!?  See if you agree with me.  (I reserve the right to change my mind...)

### Gridiron

#### National Football League: Dallas Cowboys

Of course I pull for the Cowboys.  Always have always will...even in the really crappy times.

### Baseball

#### Major League Baseball: Texas Rangers

I wasn't always a Ranger fan.  I had family in Houston and saw my first MLB game at the Astrodome.  But in High School and more in College my fandom went to the true Texas team.  And haven't looked back.  Also got my Mom enjoying the games!

### Basketball

#### National Basketball Association: Dallas Mavericks

Another team I didn't always support.  I didn't have a true team for a long time, and since the San Antonio Spurs and Houston Rockets were both better teams than the Mavericks throughout the 90's, I waffled between the three.  Around 2002, I finally committed to the Mavericks...don't know why (they still weren't all that great at that time), but have enjoyed watching them ever since.

### Hockey

#### National Hockey League: Dallas Stars

I was a Boston Bruins fan for no reason for a long time.  Texas didn't have a real hockey team and when the North Stars moved south, I didn't join in.  I didn't even move over when they won the Stanley Cup!  I've only been a Stars fan for around 4 years (at the time of this writing), and can't say I miss the Bruins.  Even when they weren't doing well, watching the young team find there identity and deal with some of the _veteran_ leadership they supposedly brought in was entertaining.

### Soccer/Futbol

#### Major League Soccer: FC Dallas

I held no soccer allegiance before moving to Dallas and as such never really followed the _Hoops_.  But around 2010-2011-ish, I started following because of Brek Shea was doing some crazy awesome stuff prior to his English and Klinsmann meltdown.  Since then I've kept up with their progress.

#### English Premier League: Liverpool FC

Because I can unite in a group of people that maintain an extreme dislike for Tom Hicks.  I figure that commonality would allow me to overlook any cultural differences if I were to attend a match...ever.

### Motor Sports

#### IndyCar: Scott Dixon

#### NASCAR: Joey Logano

#### Formula One: Daniel Ricciardo

### Cycling

#### Team: Trek-Segafredo

#### Individual: Tejay van Garderen - BMC Racing Team

### Lacrosse

#### Team: Dallas Rattlers

So didn't pay much attention to Lacrosse until my son started playing.  Then I was guessing we could be a Denver Outlaws fan based on relative proximity versus other teams...and Outlaws...you know, I'm from Texas. But Rochester moved to Dallas, so now I'm a Rattlers fan.  Being they were 3rd place prior to moving, it's even a plus that it's not a basement team.

### Golf

### Rugby

### Cricket

### Tennis

### Fighting

#### Boxing

#### Mixed Martial Arts
