title: Guilt and Shame

Guilt versus Shame has been a specific issue I've been considering. For a long time, I considered them synonymous. Through discussions with other people, counselors, and my reading; I've come to realize they are different. Different not in just how they are defined, but different in their core.

**Guilt** is defined by Webster as:

1. : the fact of having committed a breach of conduct especially violating law and involving a penalty
2. a. : the state of one who has committed an offense especially consciously
   b. : feelings of deserving blame especially for imagined offenses or from a sense of inadequacy
3. : a feeling of deserving blame for offenses <--

**Shame**, though, is defined thusly (also from Webster):

1.  a. : a painful emotion caused by consciousness of guilt, shortcoming, or impropriety
    b. : the susceptibility to such emotion
2.  : a condition of humiliating disgrace or disrepute <--
3.  a. : something that bring censure or reproach _ALSO_ : something to be regretted
    b. : a cause of feeling shame

None of these really speak directly to the differences. I've marked the items that contain the closest definition, but it still feels lacking. Since I personally approach this from a Judeo-Christian bent, I'll be addressing the differences in the same manner.

The reason I flagged the two definitions that best work is because of two words in each of the lines.

> Guilt is a _feeling_, whereas Shame is a _condition_.

There's a difference.

Guilt is understanding that you've done something wrong, maybe you need to rectify this. Guilt comes with a level healthy reproach. Your feelings of guilt, most of the time, is appropriate and leads to behavior that should correct for this. Shame, on the other hand, coincides with identity. Shame is a condition that is so pervasive that a person begins to consider that feeling as an integral part of them.

## Why Should I Care?

Apart from simply recognizing this difference and making sure that guilt you feel does not transition to shame, why is the difference important? I think as a culture, there's no more guilt...but we constantly wrestle with shame.

I do think there's an built-in human understanding of sin (regardless of if it is recognized as such). _Sin_, I'm defining with Cornelius Plantiga's definition: "Sin is culpable disturbance of shalom". And _shalom_ to be defined as: "the webbing together of God, humans, and all creation in justice, fulfillment, and delight". This has a basis in the classic objective morality argument. But with widespread acceptance of the post-modernist philosophy, we've lost culpability to any objective morality.
